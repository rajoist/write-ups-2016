Using "strings" command to view the image you get the output as:

So by seeing this we could say they've used base64 encryption.
Solving it by base64 decoder---- https://www.base64decode.org/    you get the reversestring as  " PRGYANCTFBZDXEWHVIUJSKQLOM  ".


Using this solve the remaining textusing substitution cipher with the known alphabets as  " PRGYANCTFBZDXEWHVIUJSKQLOM  "..

You will get a the reverse as   THE FLAG YOU ARE LOOKING FOR IS F0RTYTW0F0R3V3R.
There is your flag :-)
